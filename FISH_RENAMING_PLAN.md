# Fish Renaming Plan

This document outlines the renaming strategy for duplicate fish across biomes.
Each renamed fish will match its biome's theme and have updated descriptions.

**Rules:**
- ✅ Rename all duplicates EXCEPT Legendary and Exotic rarities
- ✅ Match biome themes (prehistoric, cosmic, magical, etc.)
- ✅ Update descriptions to reflect new names and characteristics
